# Workflow 1: Hello World
#
# This is the simplest possible GitHub Actions workflow.
# It introduces the core building blocks:
#   - name:     A human-readable label shown in the Actions UI
#   - on:       The event(s) that trigger this workflow
#   - jobs:     One or more independent units of work
#   - steps:    Individual tasks that run inside a job, in order
#
# TRIGGERS used here:
#   push         – runs every time code is pushed to the main branch
#   workflow_dispatch – adds a "Run workflow" button in the Actions UI
#                      so you can trigger it manually at any time

name: 01 · Hello World

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch: # allows manual trigger from the Actions tab

# Security best practice: restrict the GITHUB_TOKEN to only what this
# workflow needs. This workflow doesn't call the GitHub API at all, so
# we grant no permissions (empty block = all permissions denied).
permissions: {}
jobs:
  # A job is a set of steps that runs on the same virtual machine (runner).
  # You can have multiple jobs in one workflow (see workflow 04).
  say-hello:
    # The runner is a fresh virtual machine provided by GitHub.
    # 'ubuntu-latest' is the most common choice.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Each step either runs a shell command (run:) or calls a
      # pre-built Action (uses:).

      # Step 1 – print a simple greeting
      - name: Print greeting
        run: echo "Hello, World! 👋"

      # Step 2 – show some built-in context GitHub provides automatically
      - name: Show workflow context
        run: |
          echo "Repository : ${{ github.repository }}"
          echo "Branch     : ${{ github.ref_name }}"
          echo "Triggered by: ${{ github.actor }}"
          echo "Run number : ${{ github.run_number }}"

      # Step 3 – multi-line shell script
      - name: Do some simple math
        run: |
          echo "Counting to five..."
          for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
            echo "  $i"
